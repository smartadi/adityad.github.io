## Photorealistic Simulation Design for Vision Based Navigation
For application of a ML based state estimator used for state feedback in navigation systems, a robust simulation environment needs to be designed. I have worked on robust control and trajectory design methods for such systems. To setup these problems, a simulation environment needs to be built which can encorporate realistic visuals and emulate relistic cameras. The simulator needs to be modular enough to work with custom dynamic engines and ML algorithms that can process the image outputs. Finally a robust controller algorithm need to interact with the uncertain ML output and give the best course of action.\

To facilitate this, I designed a modular sim in Unreal Engine which runs Python scripts to interact with a dynamic sim written in MATLAB or python while a thrid script runs the ML algorithm. Ive tested this for space environments where a satellite proximity operations are performed. The satellite is in a Low Earth orbit is trying to rendezvous with a uncontrolled spacecraft.

Currently there are a few UE based sims available commercially, showing the importance of such a tool in research as well as in industry.
