## AA 101, Fall 2022,  Pre-doctoral Lecturer UW,  
Introduction to air and space vehicles.

I was the lecturer for the course that I designed alongside John Correy(correjoh@uw.edu) for encouraging students from outside the Aerospace department to come and learn about Airplanes and Space Vehicles. The departments runs this course every year to motivate students form different backgrounds to come and experience how Aerospace engineers design, build and fly their vehicles. I gave lectures on the history and recent advances in Aerospace and Aeronautics. The lectures were complimented by lab sessions where students learned about fluid dynamics, propulsion, controls and structures through fun experiments. We organized quizes and a project session to challenge the students to think like engineers and demostrate something they learned during the course.

## Fundamentals of Robotics Summer 2018
A summer position at [UWStemsub(check them out!)](https://uwmsub.org/) for teaching students coming from Low-income and potential first-generation college students interested in STEM fields. The goal is to give the students a head start to their colege prep and gain extra credits. 
I was the instructor for Robotics Design course, where we developed a introductory robotics course covering basics in physics, math and programming integrated with practical applications of mobile robots. I course was geared towards high school students.\
